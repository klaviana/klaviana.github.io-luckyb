        <p> &emsp; Lucky b is short for Lucky baller because he gets buckets. Hailing from the Connecticut 
            River Valley, he in fact group up ten minutes from the Basketball Hall of Fame. His five year
            plan is to have his musicianship earn him a nod to the NBA all-star celebrity game, where
            he will drop a 70 burger, earn a ten-day contract with the Celtics, and proceed to coin the
            nickname "the 3-headed monster" as he wins Banner 18 alongside Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown.</p>
            <br />
        <p> &emsp; Oh and his music is dank. He is a student of the game and has drawn from artists of all generations.
            Marvin Gaye and Bob Dylan were some of his earliest inspirations, and these days he finds himself 
            inspired by artists like SZA, Frank Ocean, and Juice WRLD. He is constantly putting himself outside
            his comfort zone. I don't know why I'm writing in the third person.</p>
            <br />
        <p> &emsp; He has split time recently between California, Nashville, and Connecticut. He wishes you much Luck
            and hopes you strive to be the best you can b. </p>
